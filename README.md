This repository is a compilation of all the stages/exercises we made for the WS22 Machine Learning course of TU Wien.
The code in the first 3 exercises isn't correctly organized into Jupyter Notebooks as we were still learning, but the last one is.

## ML Ex0

In the first exercise we were aked to treat the data from 2 different datasets. One of them is about European Football results and the other one's about player's Gambling Behaviours and Statistics. We later changed this last dataset.

## ML Ex1

For this exercise we were tasked with making predictions on the previous 2 datasets plus 2 addtional ones: Amazon Commerce Reviews and Congressional Voting. To make the predicions, and we chose Decisions Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors and the Naive Bayes Classifiers.


## ML Ex2

For Ex2 we implemented 2 different algorithms from scratch and tested them in our datasets, a classification one and a regression one. The classification one was the Naive Bayes Classifier and the regression one was a Polynomial Multiple Regression.

## ML Ex3

In the last exercise we implemented various different feature extraction algorithms to classify 2 different datasets, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10.

Firstly we implemented shallow algorithms like Decisions Trees and Support Vector Machines applied on Color Histograms and SIFT-extracted features. 

We then used 3 different deep neural network algorithms, LeNet, ResNet, and a custom-made one, to classify the images.

More information can be found in pdf report file inside the ML Ex3 folder.
