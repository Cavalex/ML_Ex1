# ML_Ex1

Since the teachers asked us to, we removed the datasets from here.
To use with the "Amazon Commerce Reviews" and "Congressional Voting" datasets, please insert them on the data/datasets folder under the name "amz.csv" and "voting.csv" respectively. For the test datasets, place them under data/tests with the names mentioned before. 

The Predictions folder will contain the predictions for both of them in case all of this was correctly followed, but either way we will leave them there because it was asked.

To install all the dependencies, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the model and get the results, run:
```
python main.py

// OR, in linux:

python3 main.py
```
